```
npm install -g @affinidi/cli
```

To check Affinidi CLI version:

```
affinidi --version
```

### Authentication:

You will need your email address, and then the code sent to your email to confirm authentication.

To create an account:
```
affinidi sign-up
```

If you already have an account:

```
affinidi login
```

### Create or activate a project:

The `create` command creates and activates a project. Follow the prompts to choose a name or add a name directly after the command.

```
affinidi create project
```

The `use` command activates an already existing project:

```
affinidi use project [<project-id>]
```

You can also simply type this and follow the prompts to choose from a list of existing projects:

```
affinidi use project
```
To see the details of project for API key hash, DID and Project ID
